Excellent question! 🔍
Let’s break it down clearly — both syntaxes are valid **but they do very different things**.

---

## 🧠 1. `Playlist.find({ owner: userId })` ✅

This works **because**:

* You're saying:
  👉 “Find all playlists where the `owner` field matches `userId`”
* This is a **query filter** — it returns **multiple documents** (as an array) that match.

### Example:

```js
// userId = "abc123"

await Playlist.find({ owner: "abc123" })
```

✅ This is **correct** because:

* You're querying the `owner` field (which is a reference to a user’s `_id`)
* It will return **all playlists** that belong to that user

---

## 🛑 2. `Playlist.findById(userId)`

This is **not correct** in this context **because**:

* `findById()` is used to find a document by its **own `_id` field**, **not** a nested field like `owner`.

### You are saying:

> “Find the playlist whose `_id` is `userId`”

But that's wrong logic — the userId is the ID of a **user**, not a **playlist**.

## 🔍 Summary

| Method                             | What it does                             | Should you use it here? |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `Playlist.find({ owner: userId })` | Finds all playlists by that user (owner) | ✅ Yes                   |
| `Playlist.findById(userId)`        | Finds a playlist whose `_id` is `userId` | ❌ No — wrong assumption |

---

## ✅ When to use `findById()`?

Only when you're looking up a document **by its `_id`** directly.
Example:

```js
const playlist = await Playlist.findById(playlistId) // ✅
```

---

Let me know if you want to filter playlists by `name`, paginate results, or populate `videos` inside each one.
