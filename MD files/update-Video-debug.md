# TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'trim')
    We got this error because we were using post instead of using patch for data update

# Solution
    Change post -> patch

```js
// debug code
console.log("req.body:", req.body) // Debug log
console.log("req.file:", req.file) // Debug log (if file uploaded)
console.log("req.params:", req.params) // Debug log 
```

    also we implemented
```js
    const video = await Video.findByIdAndUpdate(
        videoId, 
        updateData,
        {new: true, runValidators: true} // <-- for getting updated datas
    )
```

# New things we Learn
## req.param VS res.query
    req.param -> we are accessing only the url
    req.query -> we are accessing the url but also we are passing few arguments like(page, limit, query, id)

## form-data VS json(raw -> json)
    If we are sending the data (text type like title, description etc)-> use json
    but,
    If we are sending the data (along with the image or video) -> use form-data


# ðŸ”´ Critical Issues:

    Line 3: const { title, description, thumbnail, video } = req.body

    Problem: You're destructuring thumbnail and video from req.body, but they come from req.files
    Fix: Remove thumbnail, video from destructuring

    handle the undefine case earlier i was handling only the empty string part

# Learning 
    for deletion use existing video url form database
    for upading use local file passed by user -> req.files(multer)

# ðŸŸ¢ Flow Analysis:
    Your flow is correct:
    
    âœ… Get data from request
    âœ… Validate videoId
    âœ… Check files exist
    âœ… Extract file paths
    âœ… Find existing video
    âœ… Validate text fields
    âœ… Delete old files â†’ Upload new files
    âœ… Update database
    âœ… Return response
