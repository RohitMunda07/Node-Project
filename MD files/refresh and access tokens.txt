what is the perpose of Access Token and Refresh Token?

-> It prevents user to add his login credential again and again
-> Access Token is short term
-> Refresh Token is long term

if Access Token expires then simply hit an endPoint to refresh tokne and re-enable your Access Token

Refresh Token is stored in database and also we can request this token and it's done by front-end
so we need to give him an endPoint
