# Node-Project
# Always use try-catch syntax
# Use Async-await
# Database is in another continent
# Bcrypt is used for password hashing 
# Aggeregation pipline used for handling query request and more
# MiddleWare -> if you are going meet me
# For using Multer :-
## first -> configure it 
## second -> simply import wherever you need to use it
## multer is used just before the execution of any method

## This is a middleware that starts just before the saving password
userSchema.pre("save", async function (next) {
    this.password = bcript.hash(this.pasq, 10)
    next( )
})

so whenever the user tries to save the file i will always encrypt the password

üîç 1. express.json()

app.use(express.json());
Purpose: Parses incoming requests with JSON payloads.

When used: When the client sends data like this:
Content-Type: application/json
with a body:
{
  "email": "user@gmail.com",
  "password": "123456"
}
Effect: Populates req.body with the parsed object.


üîç 2. express.urlencoded({ extended: true })
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
Purpose: Parses incoming requests with URL-encoded payloads (like HTML form submissions).

When used: When the client sends data using:
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

with a body:
name=rohit&email=rohit@gmail.com
extended: true: Allows nested objects in the payload, like:
{ user: { name: "Rohit" } }
Internally uses the qs library instead of the simpler querystring.
